When looking at the summary you can see that ground clearance and vehicle length have the highest have strong likely hood of impacting the total MPG. While All Whell Drive, Spoiler Angle, and Vehicle Weight does not seem to be as good of a predictor for the MPG of the vehicle.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The Suspension_Coil.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe
An RScript is written to create a total summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI for all manufacturing lots
An RScript is written to create a lot summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

A lot of people will look at the total cost of the purchase of the car and not take into account what the total cost of the cosumer will be for the life of the vehicle. The second value has a lot more to do with what the cost to maintain the vehicle will be compared to cheaper or more expensive vehicles.

We should also test the following safety rating, horsepower, and highway fuel efficiency, to make sure weâ€™re addressing a wider range of consumers concerns.

The Null Hypothesis would be that MechaCar is outperforming its competitors based on the selected variables and criteria. The Alternative Hypothesis would negate this, that MechaCar is not outperforming the competition.

Ha(Alternative Hypothesis): Based off the performance metrics of horsepower, weight, mpg, clearance, and AWD the average cost of maintenance for a car from MechaCars is different then the cost of its 2 closests competitors.

Data would need to be collected from both MechaCar and its competitors concerning overall cost, fuel efficiency and maintenance; this data would all need to be commensurable.
